# The Best of Product Management

Hi there! Something that we've noticed at Inroad is that there's a lot of great Product Management content on the internet, and luckily enough, a lot of it is free! We've tried to consolidate all the best resources we've found around the internet and organize it into a syllabus of sorts. 

Of course, we understand that every organization asks something different of its Product function. There are drastic differences between an early-stage startup looking for product market fit and a well-established company looking to capitalize on existing customer relationships. We believe the material below is applicable across the board. Established companies should be thinking about approaching new businesses like startups to avoid being disrupted. Startups should also be aware of how short-term traction can inform long-term strategy planning.

We've also separated out the "Problem Space" from the "Solution Space." A lot of the available resources in the Product Management space today dive deeply into solutions and execution, but we think what separates great Product Managers from the rest is a more complete understanding of the problems they're trying to solve. We'll get into that a bit more later. 

We've enabled comments using Disqus, so please feel free to leave any feedback in the comments section on the right. As usual, also feel free to email us at [hello@inroad.co](mailto:hello@inroad.co)!

We've organized the Best of Product Management  as follows:

<ol type="I">
      <li><a href="#first-h">What is Product Management?</a></li>
      <li><a href="#second-h">Problem Space: Understanding the Customer</a></li>
      <li><a href="#third-h">Problem Space: Understanding the Industry</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fourth-h">Problem Space: Identifying Opportunities</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fifth-h">Solutions Space: The Roadmap</a></li>
      <li><a href="#sixth-h">Solutions Space: Validating Solutions and Defining the Product</a></li>
      <li><a href="#seventh-h">Solutions Space: The Spec aka PRD</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eigth-h">Execution: Managing the Build</a></li>
      <li><a href="#ninth-h">Execution: Releasing</a></li>
      <li><a href="#tenth-h">Other Helpful Resources</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eleventh-h">Bonus: Building a PM Org</a></li>
</ol>

By no means should this serve as a comprehensive syllabus, but we've found these resources to be helpful to our clients in the past. Hopefully they're helpful to you as well!

<h2 id="first-h">I. What is Product Management?</h2>

The “job” of a Product Manager, at its core, is actually pretty simple. Ultimately, the Product Manager is responsible for the success of the products and features they oversee within a company. How they go about defining and obtaining that success is the tricky part. Before jumping into the job itself, let's find out a bit more about the history of Product Management.

<h3>History of Product Management </h3>

[Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) is an experienced Product Manager who cofounded the blog "Mind the Product" (one of our favorites). In his article on [The History and Evolution of Product Management](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/10/history-evolution-product-management/) he breaks out how we got here. 

If you Prefer an audio version, feel free to listen to [The (Abbreviated) History Of Product Management](http://rocketship.fm/episodes/the_abbreviated_history_of_product_management/) podcast by [Rocketship.fm](http://rocketship.fm):

      </div><br>


<h3>So... What is Product Management?</h3>

Ok, so back to the original question. We think [Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) does an excellent job of answering this question in his post [What Exactly is a Product Manager?](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/). We promise we won't exclusively link to his content, but as one of the most well-regarded voices in the Product Management community, we think he does an awesome job of setting the table here.

While we’re not associated with the many Product Management courses available online, we do recognize that they’ve produced some helpful (and sometimes free) resources. One of those is [The Product Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-product-podcast/id1219400787) from [Product School](https://www.productschool.com/). They do a really nice job in their “What is Product Management?” podcast of explaining what Product Management is (and is not):

      </div><br>
      
      
<h3>The Product Lifecycle</h3>
So what are the steps that Product Managers go through in order to achieve their goals? This post, [Great PMs don’t spend their time on solutions](https://www.intercom.com/blog/great-product-managers-dont-spend-time-on-solutions) by Intercom (a B2B messaging apps company) talks at length about The Product Lifecycle and where Product Managers should be spending their time. An important takeaway here is that great Product Managers have a deep understanding of the problems that they're trying to solve before they ever start thinking about solutions.


<h3>Good vs Great Product Management</h3>

We now have a good understanding of what Product Managers are responsible for, broadly speaking, but what does great Product Management look like? As we said earlier, great PMs understand the problem. Said another way, they understand the customer and the customer's problems before trying to come up with solutions. To open this up a bit, let's ask some the "greats" to define greatness in Product Management:

[Good Product Manager / Bad Product Manager](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) by [Ben Horowitz](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz) is a post that you've probably seen before if you've done any reading on Product Management before this. Ben founded and ran the enterprise software company, Opsware, before founding and running the venture capital firm, Andreeson Horowitz. Ben prefaces this blog post with a warning, "This document was written 15 years ago and is probably not relevant for today’s product managers. I present it here merely as an example of a useful training document.” It holds up.

[Ian McAllister](http://twitter.com/ianmcall) provides a helpful take on this question on Quora in his answer to [What distinguishes the Top 1% of product managers from the Top 10%?](https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-Top-1-of-product-managers-from-the-Top-10/answer/Ian-McAllister). Ian was a Product Manager at Microsoft, Amazon, and Airbnb. With experience like that, he found himself well-equipped to answer this question on Quora.

We don't think an MBA is a requirement for great Product Management, but we do think publications like the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/) are incredibly helpful resources. [What It Takes to Become a Great Product Manager](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager) by [Julia Austin](https://twitter.com/austinfish) is one such resource. Julia is a Senior Lecturer in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at the Harvard Business School. She also has deep experience on the operating and advising side. One of the things I like about this article is looking beyond core competencies to look at EQ and company fit. 

Great Product Managers are also willing to take great (calculated) risks - especially when the pace of business necessitates it. In his talk "10x Not 10% : Product Management by Orders of Magnitude" [Ken Norton](https://twitter.com/kennethn), Product Manager and Senior Operating Partner at Google Ventures, talks about how Product Managers should fight their instinct for loss aversion and go for moonshots:

<h2 id="second-h">II. Understanding the Customer</h2>

Products are solutions and before you develop a smart solution, you need a complete understanding of the problem. In the case of a business, the problem is the job that the customer is paying you to do. It’s important to remember that your customers are people (assuming you’re reading this before The Robot Revolution). Understanding your customers on a “personal” level is probably the most important skill that a product manager can have. We recognize that there are likely going to be multiple customers (stakeholders) that the Product Team should be concerned with - including internal stakeholders and external decision makers, but for the purpose of this guide, we’ll focus on the end users. We need to get to know the end user above all others because ultimately these are the customers we’re trying to serve.

<h3>Customers First</h3>

We'd be remiss if we didn't have at least one piece of content here from the great Steve Jobs. This video is from Apple's 1997  Worldwide Developer Conference. In it, Steve Jobs explains to a disgruntled developer why it's important to start with the customer and not with the technology:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FF-tKLISfPE?rel=0&hd=1 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

There's a lot of great information out there on user research, but we think the article [The Product Manager Superpower: User Science](https://medium.com/@tworetzky/the-product-manager-superpower-user-science-7296134ae5a4) does a nice job of laying out what different customer touch points might look like, and how you get user-centric information back into your company.

One important note that you may get, in a B2B company in particular, is distinguishing between users and buyers. As a Product Manager your job is not to build for buyers. [This article](https://hbr.org/2018/02/the-most-successful-brands-focus-on-users-not-buyers) in HBR explains why.

<h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>
[Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) once said "“It’s better to have 100 people that love you than a million people that just sort of like you. Find 100 people that love you.” As a Product Manager, it's not your job to make every possible customer happy. It is your job, however, to have a deep understanding of the customers that you are targeting with your product.

There are a number of different ways you can segment a customer base. [The 6 Types of User Segmentation and What They Mean for Your Product](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-think-segmentation-from-day-1-f714df093ccb) does a very good job at explaining some of the traditional ways businesses segment customers. Although those methods can come in handy from time to time, we think there's probably a better way of segmenting users around what they actually need from the products you might build.


<h3>Needs-based Segmentation and Jobs to be Done</h3>

Harvard professor, Theodore Levitt, is often quoted as saying, "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole." We think this quote perfectly distills down the idea of "Jobs to be done." The educator who popularized this idea is another Harvard Professor named [Clayton Christensen](https://twitter.com/claychristensen). Here, Clayton explains what he means when he talks about jobs to be done. If you're already a Product Manager, and you've heard the term "milkshakes," this is where it comes from:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1SfUsSyGWJ8?t=8&rel=0&hd=1 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

For a bit more information on jobs to be done - see Clayton Christensen's post in HBR [Know Your Customers’ “Jobs to Be Done”](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done). HBR also put out a helpful podcast on the topic:

<div class="audio-responsive">
<iframe style="border: solid 1px #dedede;"  src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/6655/48484546" width="100%" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div><br>

So now that we know what a "Job to be Done" is, how does this affect how we segment users? The post [Market Segmentation Through a Jobs to Be Done Lens](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/market-segmentation-through-a-jobs-to-be-done-lens-5ef9242de65) by [Tony Ulwick](https://twitter.com/Ulwick). Here, Tony explains why typical methods of market segmentation are often inneffective for creating helpful products. 

For a deeper understanding of some of these concepts, I'd recommend reading Tony's book, [What Customers Want](https://www.amazon.com/What-Customers-Want-Outcome-Driven-Breakthrough/dp/0071408673). The book maps out exactly how to use customer input to drive innovative Product decisions. Another helpful (and free!) book on these concepts comes from [Alan Klement](https://twitter.com/alanklement?lang=en) called [When Coffee and Kale Compete](http://www.whencoffeeandkalecompete.com).

<h3>The Technology Adoption Life Cycle</h3>
So we have our target customer segments, which are informed by "Jobs to be Done." Before moving on, we think it's also important to understand where these customers fall on the Technology Adoption Life Cycle. For an overview of what we're talking about, check out this video:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9QnfWhtujPA?t=8&rel=0&hd=1 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

Ultimately, customers at different stages of this cycle have different expectations of products. It's important that you understand these expectations before starting to think about what solutions may be appropriate for these customers. The "bible" on this topic is [Crossing the Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123) by [Geoffrey Moore](https://twitter.com/geoffreyamoore).
