# The Best of Product Management

Hi there! Something that we've noticed at Inroad is that there's a lot of great Product Management content on the internet, and luckily enough, a lot of it is free! We've tried to consolidate all the best resources we've found around the internet and organize it into a syllabus of sorts. 

Of course, we understand that every organization asks something different of its Product function. There are drastic differences between an early-stage startup looking for product market fit and a well-established company looking to capitalize on existing customer relationships. We believe the material below is applicable across the board. Established companies should be thinking about approaching new businesses like startups to avoid being disrupted. Startups should also be aware of how short-term traction can inform long-term strategy planning.

We've enabled comments using Disqus, so please feel free to leave any feedback in the comments section on the right. As usual, also feel free to email us at [hello@inroad.co](mailto:hello@inroad.co)!

We've organized the Best of Product Management  as follows:

<ol type="I">
      <li><a href="#first-h">What is Product Management?</a></li>
      <li><a href="#second-h">Understanding the Customer</a></li>
      <li><a href="#third-h">Marrying Business and Product Strategy</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fourth-h">Defining the Product: Vision, Objective, Key Result</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fifth-h">The Roadmap</a></li>
      <li><a href="#sixth-h">The Spec aka PRD</a></li>
      <li><a href="#seventh-h">Validating your Solution</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eigth-h">Managing the Build</a></li>
      <li><a href="#ninth-h">Releasing</a></li>
      <li><a href="#tenth-h">Other Helpful Resources</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eleventh-h">Bonus: Building a PM Org</a></li>
</ol>

By no means should this serve as a comprehensive syllabus, but we've found these resources to be helpful to our clients in the past. Hopefully they're helpful to you as well!

<h2 id="first-h">I. What is Product Management?</h2>

The ‚Äújob‚Äù of a Product Manager, at its core, is actually pretty simple. Ultimately, the Product Manager is responsible for the success of the products and features they oversee within a company. How they go about defining and obtaining that success is the tricky part. Before jumping into the job itself, let's find out a bit more about the history of Product Management.

<h3>History of Product Management </h3>

[Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) is an experienced Product Manager who cofounded the blog "Mind the Product" (one of our favorites). In his article on [The History and Evolution of Product Management](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/10/history-evolution-product-management/) he breaks out how we got here. 

If you Prefer an audio version, feel free to listen to [The (Abbreviated) History Of Product Management](http://rocketship.fm/episodes/the_abbreviated_history_of_product_management/) podcast by [Rocketship.fm](http://rocketship.fm):

<h3>So... What is Product Management?</h3>

Ok, so back to the original question. We think [Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) does an excellent job of answering this question in his post [What Exactly is a Product Manager?](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/). We promise we won't exclusively link to his content, but as one of the most well-regarded voices in the Product Management community, we think he does an awesome job of setting the table here.

While we‚Äôre not associated with the many Product Management courses available online, we do recognize that they‚Äôve produced some helpful (and sometimes free) resources. One of those is [The Product Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-product-podcast/id1219400787) from [Product School](https://www.productschool.com/). They do a really nice job in their ‚ÄúWhat is Product Management?‚Äù podcast of explaining what Product Management is (and is not):

<h3>Good vs Great Product Management</h3>

We now have a good understanding of what Product Managers are responsible for, broadly speaking, but what does great Product Management look like? To answer that question, let's ask some "the greats" to define greatness:

[Good Product Manager / Bad Product Manager] (https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) by [Ben Horowitz](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz) is a post that you've probably seen before if you've done any reading on Product Management before this. Ben founded and ran the enterprise software company, Opsware, before founding and running the venture capital firm, Andreeson Horowitz. Ben prefaces this blog post with a warning, "This document was written 15 years ago and is probably not relevant for today‚Äôs product managers. I present it here merely as an example of a useful training document.‚Äù It holds up.

[Ian McAllister]((http://twitter.com/ianmcall) provides a helpful take on this question on Quora in his answer to [What distinguishes the Top 1% of product managers from the Top 10%?](https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-Top-1-of-product-managers-from-the-Top-10/answer/Ian-McAllister). Ian was a Product Manager at Microsoft, Amazon, and Airbnb. With experience like that, he found himself well-equipped to answer this question on Quora.

We don't think an MBA is a requirement for great Product Management, but we do think publications like the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/) are incredibly helpful resources. [What It Takes to Become a Great Product Manager](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager) by [Julia Austin](https://twitter.com/austinfish) is one such resource. Julia is a Senior Lecturer in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at the Harvard Business School. She also has deep experience on the operating and advising side. One of the things I like about this article is looking beyond core competencies to look at EQ and company fit. 

You'll often see references to great Product Managers being the "CEOs of their products." Practically speaking, that definition doesn't really make sense, because Product Managers don't have the organizational authority that CEOs do. In his talk "Gods, Superheroes, and Product Managers" [Randy Silver](http://twitter.com/randy_silver) talks about how Product Managers should interact with other members of organization without authority built in:
