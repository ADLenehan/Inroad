# The Best of Product Management

Hi there! Something that we've noticed at Inroad is that there's a lot of great Product Management content on the internet, and luckily enough, a lot of it is free! We've tried to consolidate all the best resources we've found around the internet and organize it into a syllabus of sorts. 

Of course, we understand that every organization asks something different of its Product function. There are drastic differences between an early-stage startup looking for product market fit and a well-established company looking to capitalize on existing customer relationships. We believe the material below is applicable pretty much across the board, but have made some distinctions between new and existing products (or features). 

We've enabled comments using Disqus, so please feel free to leave any feedback in the comments section on the right. As usual, also feel free to email us at [hello@inroad.co](mailto:hello@inroad.co)!

We've organized the Best of Product Management  as follows:

<ol type="I">
      <li><a href="#first-h">What is Product Management?</a></li>
      <li><a href="#second-h">Problem Space: Understanding the Customer</a></li>
      <li><a href="#third-h">Problem Space: Understanding the Industry</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fourth-h">Problem Space: Identifying Opportunities</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fifth-h">Solutions Space: The Roadmap</a></li>
      <li><a href="#sixth-h">Solutions Space: Validating Solutions and Defining the Product</a></li>
      <li><a href="#seventh-h">Solutions Space: The Spec aka PRD</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eigth-h">Execution: Managing the Build</a></li>
      <li><a href="#ninth-h">Execution: Releasing</a></li>
      <li><a href="#tenth-h">Other Helpful Resources</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eleventh-h">Bonus: Building a PM Org</a></li>
</ol>

By no means should this serve as a comprehensive syllabus, but we've found these resources to be helpful to our clients in the past. Hopefully they're helpful to you as well!

<h2 id="first-h">I. What is Product Management?</h2>

The “job” of a Product Manager, at its core, is actually pretty simple. Ultimately, the Product Manager is responsible for the success of the products and features they oversee within a company. How they go about defining and obtaining that success is the tricky part. Before jumping into the job itself, let's find out a bit more about the history of Product Management.

<h3>History of Product Management </h3>

[Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) is an experienced Product Manager who cofounded the blog "Mind the Product" (one of our favorites). In his article on [The History and Evolution of Product Management](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/10/history-evolution-product-management/) he breaks out how we got here. 

If you Prefer an audio version, feel free to listen to [The (Abbreviated) History Of Product Management](http://rocketship.fm/episodes/the_abbreviated_history_of_product_management/) podcast by [Rocketship.fm](http://rocketship.fm):

      </div><br>


<h3>So... What is Product Management?</h3>

Ok, so back to the original question. We think [Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) does an excellent job of answering this question in his post [What Exactly is a Product Manager?](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/). We promise we won't exclusively link to his content, but as one of the most well-regarded voices in the Product Management community, we think he does an awesome job of setting the table here.

While we’re not associated with the many Product Management courses available online, we do recognize that they’ve produced some helpful (and sometimes free) resources. One of those is [The Product Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-product-podcast/id1219400787) from [Product School](https://www.productschool.com/). They do a really nice job in their “What is Product Management?” podcast of explaining what Product Management is (and is not):


<div class="audio-responsive">
<iframe style="border: solid 1px #dedede;"  src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/134992/58323123" width="100%" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div><br>
      
      
<h3>The Product Lifecycle</h3>
So what are the steps that Product Managers go through in order to achieve their goals? This post, [Great PMs don’t spend their time on solutions](https://www.intercom.com/blog/great-product-managers-dont-spend-time-on-solutions) by Intercom (a B2B messaging apps company) talks at length about The Product Lifecycle and where Product Managers should be spending their time. An important takeaway here is that great Product Managers have a deep understanding of the problems that they're trying to solve before they ever start thinking about solutions.


<h3>Good vs Great Product Management</h3>

We now have a good understanding of what Product Managers are responsible for, broadly speaking, but what does great Product Management look like? As we said earlier, great PMs understand the problem. Said another way, they understand the customer and the customer's problems before trying to come up with solutions. To open this up a bit, let's ask some the "greats" to define greatness in Product Management:

[Good Product Manager / Bad Product Manager](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) by [Ben Horowitz](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz) is a post that you've probably seen before if you've done any reading on Product Management before this. Ben founded and ran the enterprise software company, Opsware, before founding and running the venture capital firm, Andreeson Horowitz. Ben prefaces this blog post with a warning, "This document was written 15 years ago and is probably not relevant for today’s product managers. I present it here merely as an example of a useful training document.” It holds up.

Great Product Managers also think about achieving outcomes vs building features. This way, both the Product Manager and the organization at large have a better understanding of whether or not products are actually achieving the right goals (the goals of the user). Max Bennett does an excellent job of explaining this distinction in his post [Great Product Managers are “Outcome Thinkers”](https://medium.com/@max.bennett/great-product-managers-are-outcome-thinkers-66fa5d69cfac).

[Ian McAllister](http://twitter.com/ianmcall) provides a helpful take on this question on Quora in his answer to [What distinguishes the Top 1% of product managers from the Top 10%?](https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-Top-1-of-product-managers-from-the-Top-10/answer/Ian-McAllister). Ian was a Product Manager at Microsoft, Amazon, and Airbnb. With experience like that, he found himself well-equipped to answer this question on Quora.

We don't think an MBA is a requirement for great Product Management, but we do think publications like the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/) are incredibly helpful resources. [What It Takes to Become a Great Product Manager](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager) by [Julia Austin](https://twitter.com/austinfish) is one such resource. Julia is a Senior Lecturer in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at the Harvard Business School. She also has deep experience on the operating and advising side. One of the things I like about this article is looking beyond core competencies to look at EQ and company fit. 

Great Product Managers are also willing to take great (calculated) risks - especially when the pace of business necessitates it. In his talk "10x Not 10% : Product Management by Orders of Magnitude" [Ken Norton](https://twitter.com/kennethn), Product Manager and Senior Operating Partner at Google Ventures, talks about how Product Managers should fight their instinct for loss aversion and go for moonshots:

<h2 id="second-h">II. Understanding the Customer</h2>

Products are solutions and before you develop a smart solution, you need a complete understanding of the problem. In the case of a business, the problem is the job that the customer is paying you to do. It’s important to remember that your customers are people (assuming you’re reading this before The Robot Revolution). Understanding your customers on a “personal” level is probably the most important skill that a product manager can have. We recognize that there are likely going to be multiple customers (stakeholders) that the Product Team should be concerned with - including internal stakeholders and external decision makers, but for the purpose of this guide, we’ll focus on the end users. We need to get to know the end user above all others because ultimately these are the customers we’re trying to serve.

<h3>Customers First</h3>

We'd be remiss if we didn't have at least one piece of content here from the great Steve Jobs. This video is from Apple's 1997  Worldwide Developer Conference. In it, Steve Jobs explains to a disgruntled developer why it's important to start with the customer and not with the technology:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FF-tKLISfPE?rel=0&hd=1 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

<h3>Collecting Information</h3>
There's a lot of great information out there on user research, but we think the article [The Product Manager Superpower: User Science](https://medium.com/@tworetzky/the-product-manager-superpower-user-science-7296134ae5a4) does a nice job of laying out what different customer touch points might look like, and how you get user-centric information back into your company.

One important note that you may get, in a B2B company in particular, is distinguishing between users and buyers. As a Product Manager your job is not to build for buyers. [This article](https://hbr.org/2018/02/the-most-successful-brands-focus-on-users-not-buyers) in HBR explains why.

<h3>Jobs to be Done</h3>

Harvard professor, Theodore Levitt, is often quoted as saying, "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole." We think this quote perfectly distills down the idea of "Jobs to be done." The educator who popularized this idea is another Harvard Professor named [Clayton Christensen](https://twitter.com/claychristensen). Here, Clayton explains what he means when he talks about jobs to be done. If you're already a Product Manager, and you've heard the term "milkshakes," this is where it comes from:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1SfUsSyGWJ8?t=8&rel=0&hd=1 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

For a bit more information on jobs to be done - see Clayton Christensen's post in HBR [Know Your Customers’ “Jobs to Be Done”](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done). HBR also put out a helpful podcast on the topic:

<div class="audio-responsive">
<iframe style="border: solid 1px #dedede;"  src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/6655/48484546" width="100%" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div><br>
      
As a Product Manager, once our product has been released, we want consumers to "hire" our product to do a job for them. In diagnosing all of the components that ultimately go into that job, it's important to understand the steps that a consumer goes through in completing that job and understand customer needs at every step. [Tony Ulwick](https://twitter.com/Ulwick) defines "customer outcomes" and breaks down how to solicit them in his article [https://hbr.org/2002/01/turn-customer-input-into-innovation](https://hbr.org/2002/01/turn-customer-input-into-innovation).

<h3>Traditional Customer Segmentation</h3>
[Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) once said "“It’s better to have 100 people that love you than a million people that just sort of like you. Find 100 people that love you.” As a Product Manager, it's not your job to make every possible customer happy. It is your job, however, to have a deep understanding of the customers that you are targeting with your product.

There are a number of different ways you can segment a customer base. [The 6 Types of User Segmentation and What They Mean for Your Product](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-think-segmentation-from-day-1-f714df093ccb) does a very good job at explaining some of the traditional ways businesses segment customers. Although those methods can come in handy from time to time, we think there's probably a better way of segmenting users around what they actually need from the products you might build.

<h3>Jobs-driven Segmentation (New Products)</h3>
So now that we understand the job to be done, and how users are measuring success or failure for this particular job, how does this affect how we segment users? The post [Market Segmentation Through a Jobs to Be Done Lens](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/market-segmentation-through-a-jobs-to-be-done-lens-5ef9242de65) again by [Tony Ulwick](https://twitter.com/Ulwick). Here, Tony explains why typical methods of market segmentation are often inneffective for creating helpful products. 

Tony also offers a helpful case study on use of his frameworks through his consulting company, [Strategyn](www.strategyn.com). A deep dive on the "segmentation" element of this framework starts at 18:30:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6t2Bt0hdOus?t=8&rel=0&hd=1 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

It's interesting to note here that jobs to be done and traditional segmentation dimensions are compatible. In our estimation, you need to understand the tasks that users will need to complete, the motivation for those tasks, and who the users are beyond those tasks in order to give you a holistic view of the problem you're trying to solve. Page Laubheimer does an excellent job of explaining this in her article [Personas vs. Jobs-to-Be-Done](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-jobs-be-done). 

For a deeper understanding of some of these concepts, we'd recommend reading Tony's book, [What Customers Want](https://www.amazon.com/What-Customers-Want-Outcome-Driven-Breakthrough/dp/0071408673). The book maps out exactly how to use customer input to drive innovative Product decisions. 

<h3>The Technology Adoption Life Cycle</h3>
So we have our target customer segments, which are informed by "Jobs to be Done." Before moving on, we think it's also important to understand where these customers fall on the Technology Adoption Life Cycle. For an overview of what we're talking about, check out this video:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9QnfWhtujPA?t=8&rel=0&hd=1 " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

Ultimately, customers at different stages of this cycle have different expectations of products. It's important that you understand these expectations before starting to think about what solutions may be appropriate for these customers. The "bible" on this topic is [Crossing the Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123) by [Geoffrey Moore](https://twitter.com/geoffreyamoore). 

<h2 id="third-h">III. Understanding the Business (Existing)</h2>
Ok, so, we understand the customers we're targeting and what jobs those customers are looking to get done. As a Product Manager, you probably work within the confines of a broader company and that company should have a perspective on what value its trying to provide those customers - starting with its mission. If you're working for a startup, some of these ideas might be a bit more nascent, or what's sometimes referred to as an emergent strategy (not "top down"). We're going to keep this section fairly high level so that it's appicable across roles and companies but rest assured if you want to understand business strategy better, there is a wealth of content available outside of this outline to dive into. 

<h3>The Company Mission</h3>
Ultimately, everyone at the company should have a good understanding of what the mission is but this is especially true of Product Managers. Product Managers should be constantly referencing the company's mission as kind of a "north star" that guides product development. This TED talk by [Simon Sinek](https://twitter.com/simonsinek) does a pretty good job of explaining what makes a good mission:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

[Here](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/30-inspiring-billion-dollar-startup-company-mission-statements.html) are some other good examples of mission statements across companies. Our favorite articulation of a company mission came from the CEO of Slack, [Stewart Butterfield](https://twitter.com/stewart) in the memo he sent his company before Slack's launch entitled [We Don't Sell Saddles Here](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d).

<h3>Company Strategy</h3>
Many of these sections could be courses unto themselves. That's especially true of this section. Entire MBA programs revolve around equipping executives to become masters of strategic thinking. The term "strategy" can also be pretty abstract. In his HBR article, [Demystifying Strategy](https://hbr.org/2007/09/demystifying-strategy-the-what), HBS professor [Michael Watkins](https://twitter.com/MichaelDWatkins) describes strategy as "a set of guiding principles that, when communicated and adopted in the organization, generates a desired pattern of decision making. A strategy is therefore about how people throughout the organization should make decisions and allocate resources in order accomplish key objectives. A good strategy provides a clear roadmap, consisting of a set of guiding principles or rules, that defines the actions people in the business should take (and not take) and the things they should prioritize (and not prioritize) to achieve desired goals."

From a Product Manager's standpoint, the decisions you make on what to build and how / when to build it ultimately need to align with the business's strategy. [WTF is Strategy](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-strategy-bcaa3fda9a31) by [Vince Law](https://twitter.com/vincelawco) does an excellent job of explaining how a company's mission informs strategy, which informs roadmap, etc. 

As a bonus here, we'll direct you to Facebook VP, [Julie Zhao's](https://twitter.com/joulee) post entitled [How to be Strategic](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-be-strategic-f6630a44f86b). In it she explains what a successfully implemented strategy actually looks like out in the wild. 

<h3>Product Strategy</h3>
Product Strategy is the part of the overall business strategy that you, as a Product Manager, have control of. Within Product Strategy, we're seeking to marry what's being asked of us within the company strategy with the problems that we know our customers are actually trying to solve on the ground. The afformentioned Julie Zhao gave an excellent talk at TNW 2016 on "Building with Creative Confidence" that we think helps to bridge these two ideas:

<div class="video-responsive">
      <iframe width="560" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIm289_YMIE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

<h2 id="fourth-h">IV. Building the Roadmap</h2>
We now understand the customer, the business, and the strategy (to the extent one exists). The next step is distilling all that information down into the actual product roadmap. Because you will inevitably have a limited number of developers at your company, you'll need to be judicious about what you build and when. The product roadmap is the artifact that ultimately defines that plan. Before we jump into the process of building a roadmap, we think it makes sense to first explain what a roadmap shouldn't be: [12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2).

<h3>Roadmap Definiton</h3>
A roadmap should communicate your product strategy. A roadmap should not be a listing of the features and dates you hope to ship in the coming months, quarters, even years. A roadmap is not a release plan. Check out this talk by C. Todd Lombardo talking about what goes into a roadmap and how it relates to elements of the company mission and strategy that we've discussed to this point:

<div class="video-responsive">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/285660483" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

We also like this post by Elena Sviridenko, which talks about [Outcome-driven product roadmaps](https://productcoalition.com/outcome-driven-product-roadmap-f705c49032b2). Ultimately, we want to take the user outcomes that we've collected to this point and group them into themes. Themes will be sets of outcomes that generally relate to the same overall goal. 

<h3>OKRs</h3>
Within our discussions with design and development teams, Product Managers shouldn't be prescriptive about what the solution looks like. However, Product Managers should be prescriptive about the objective for solutions that will ultimately be designed by the broader team. If you're not familiar with what OKRs are and what they represent, check out this post by Rick Klau entitled [How Google sets goals: OKRs](https://library.gv.com/how-google-sets-goals-okrs-a1f69b0b72c7). 

In a Product context, OKRs take on a more specific meaning. Julie Zhuo breaks this out in her article [How do you set metrics?](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-do-you-set-metrics-59f78fea7e44). If you're looking for examples helpful metrics for startups, look no further than Dave Mcclure's [Pirate Metrics](https://medium.com/i-want-to-be-a-product-manager-when-i-grow-up/startup-metrics-for-pirates-aarrr-15fe3a38cf2e). 

So at this point you may ask, "I already have all of these outcomes that my users are trying to achieve, can I just use those as my OKR?" The answer is "yes," BUT make sure those outcomes are measurable and adhere to the rules outlined above.

<h3>Prioritization</h3>
We now have a list of all the things our product could potentially accomplish. We now need to order that list. As Kate Bennet states in [Product Prioritization by the Numbers](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/10/product-prioritization-numbers/), different organizations approach prioritization differently. Sometimes, it's not even the product managers making this call. 

You should have a perspective here whether or not the decision ultimately falls to you. There are a number of different approaches you can use, but they all boil down to a similar idea: which products or features will have the highest ROI for the company? 

[Folding Burritos](https://foldingburritos.com/) offers a number of helpful resources on Product Management, one of which is their semi-exaustive list of prioritization models in [20 Product Prioritization Techniques: A Map and Guided Tour](https://foldingburritos.com/product-prioritization-techniques/). 

You should also check out this podcast from The Product School:

<div class="audio-responsive">
<iframe style="border: solid 1px #dedede;"  src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/134992/62310534"  width="100%" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
      </div><br>
      
We're not going to say definitively that there's one ideal way to prioritize a backlog, but if you're looking for a simple answer here, check out Ian McAllister's answer to the question [What are the best ways to prioritize a list of product features?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-prioritize-a-list-of-product-features) on Quora.

Keep in mind that the ROI, in this case, could account for the opportunity cost associated with NOT fixing product bugs / issues. Check out the post [Juggling priorities](https://productcoalition.com/juggling-with-priorities-62ad82da591e) to see some options for incorporating bugs into the prioritization equation.

<h3>Saying "No"</h3>
Inevitably, there will be a number of opportunities that don't make the roadmap. Inevitably, a large number of these opportunities will be requests from inside your own company. As a Product Manager, you need to be able to maintain lines of communication and feedback loops throughout the organization, which means you need to be diplomatic about how and why you're saying "no" to stakeholders. This post, entitled [Negotiate like a pro: how to say ‘No’ to product feature requests…](https://hackernoon.com/negotiate-like-a-pro-how-to-say-no-to-product-feature-requests-e2ce00ae9981) does an excellent job of explaining how to say no - in a constructive way.

<h2 id="fifth-h">V. Validating Solutions</h2>
To this point, we've done no thinking about the actual "solutions." As Albert Einstein once said, "If I had only one hour to save the world, I would spend fifty-five minutes defining the problem, and only five minutes finding the solution." In Product Management terms, as we mentioned earlier, great Product Managers go deep on the problem before they ever start thinking about how to solve it. As you start to put some of these skills into practice, you'll be tempted to bring some of this solutions thinking forward in the process and start brainstorming solutions before developing a thorough understanding of the problem space. Try to avoid this - particularly in conversations you have with users. Don't cloud their perspective and input with your own ideas of how their problems should be solved. That being said, we've now entered the "solution space" of the Product Management Process. 

<h3>The Opportunity Solutions Tree</h3>
You may be curious about how many of these ideas around customer input, outcomes (OKRs), and opportunities actually fit together. There's a relatively "new" framework that we love to introduce here called the [Opportunity Solutions Tree](https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/). It was developed by [Teresa Torres](https://twitter.com/ttorres), who is an expert in Product Discovery. For an excellent overview of her take on Product Discovery and how it relates to some of the formative work in the Product space leading up to this point, watch her keynote from Productized Conference 2016 in Lisbon:

<div class="video-responsive">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7-5x0ra2tc" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

For a bit of a deeper dive on the framework, as well as a supporting podcast, see [An Introduction to Modern Product Discovery](https://medium.com/productized-blog/an-introduction-to-modern-product-discovery-by-teresa-torres-productizedconf-bb2703b01fdb) on the Productized Blog. If you remember one thing from this outline, it should probably be this relationship. 

<h3>Generating Solutions</h3>
Ok so how do we go about finding elegant solutions to these customer problems? You guessed it - brainstorming! You'll generally want to brainstorm with a UX designer and an Engineering leader, but the more folks you involve in this process, the better. Different organizations have different ways of brainstorming, but we like this guidance from organizational psychologist, [Adam Grant](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant):

<div class="video-responsive">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dIY_Zk3IiW4" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>

If you're looking for some other points of reference on how to think about brainstorming solutions, check out these articles from [HBR](https://hbr.org/2017/05/your-team-is-brainstorming-all-wrong) and [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/seven-steps-to-better-brainstorming).

<h3>Running Experiments</h3>
We want to know that our solutions are producing the outcomes our users are looking for as soon as possible. Ideally, if we're off base in any way, we'd like to learn that before our team has written a single line of code. In our estimation, there's a significant difference here between experiments you're going to run while developing new products and features at an product vs developing a new product. At a startup, you're trying to validate much more than the product, you're trying to validate the idea, market, etc (the business itself). This merits a different approach to experimentation - developing a minimum viable product instead of running a singular experiment.

<h3>The MVP - Minimum Viable Product</h3>
A lot of the literature that you'll encounter around in the Product Management world around developing Minimum Viable Products and releasing them into the world to see if the product is able to find Product-Market Fit. One of the most referenced startup posts of all time comes from [Marc Andreeson](https://twitter.com/pmarca) entitled [The only thing that matters](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html).

Andreeson's post provides an excellent overview, but we also like these posts: [Making sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product)](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp) and [What does “Minimum Viable Product” actually mean, anyway?](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/what-the-hell-does-minimum-viable-product-actually-mean-anyway-7d8f6a110f38), that actually break out the idea a little further. It's also worth checking out [The Ultimate Guide to MVP](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-ultimate-guide-to-minimum-viable-product-59218ce738f8) which breaks out a bunch of helpful tools.

If you're a working at a startup that's building or iterating on an MVP, we'd also recommend checking out the wealth of resources available to you in the [YCombinator Library](https://www.startupschool.org/library). [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) is a startup incubator that's probably helped launch more successful technology companies than any other entity in the world. 

You should also buy [Eric Reis's](https://twitter.com/ericries) [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898) immediately. It's the seminal book on product development at a startup and is the basis for a number of the ideas we've outlined here.

<h3>Experiment Design</h3>
If you have a background in Science (took a science class back in the day), you're probably familiar with The Scientific Method. We think the Scientific Method provides a pretty good framework from which to start thinking about product experimentation. Check out this talk by a Ruben Lozano, Google PM, at ProductCon Seattle 2019 about applything the Scientific Method to product experimentation:

We also really like this post from Simon Cast at Mind the Product, entitled [Everything a product manager needs to know about experiments](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2012/08/experiments-101/). In it, Simon breaks out how experiments should be designed, how to incorporate results back into your company, and some tools to use that may be helpful.  Ideally, our experiment is going to validate a hypothesis that our product is going to move our product's OKR by some amount. It's not always easy to get that result in an experiment, so think creatively about an experimental hypothesis that serves as a fair proxy for your product objective.

You should also consider that there are different types of experiments at your disposal. In the post [What Type of Lean Startup Experiment Should I Run?](https://grasshopperherder.com/what-type-of-lean-startup-experiment-should-i-run), Innovation Coach, Tristan Kromer, breaks down the types and discusses when to use each.

Experimentation and iteration should be a continuous process - if at first you don't succeed, that's normal. Companies like Optimizely specialize in this process and have published excellent posts like this one entitled [Experiment, Launch, Iterate, Repeat: Why Product Development is Never Complete](https://blog.optimizely.com/2017/09/06/experiment-launch-iterate-repeat/). You can never be 100% you're building the right product to meet your objective, but the name of the game here is hedging the risk of building the wrong product, and the process of experimentation will bring that risk down signficantly.

<h2 id="sixth-h">VI. Defining the Product</h2>

There a number of schools of thought when it comes to the "Product Requirements Document" or "PRD" or "Spec." Check out this Quora thread, [What should a lean startup functional spec / product requirements doc look like?](https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-lean-startup-functional-spec-product-requirements-doc-look-like), for a peak into what this debate looks like. Basically, there are two sides to this argument. The discenting view subscribes to the thought that in a "lean" world, PRDs "overengineer" a solution so the process is therefor counterproductive. This makes sense, but we still think (as do most established companies) that there's value in thinking through the PRD, and that [Great Product Managers Obsess over Documentation](https://slab.com/blog/why-obsessive-documentation-is-key-to-being-a-great-product-manager/), so we'll go ahead and take you through it.
