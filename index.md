# The Best of Product Management

Hi there! Something that we've noticed at Inroad is that there's a lot of great Product Management content on the internet, and luckily enough, a lot of it is free! We've tried to consolidate all the best resources we've found around the internet and organize it into a syllabus of sorts. 

Of course, we understand that every organization asks something different of its Product function. There are drastic differences between an early-stage startup looking for product market fit and a well-established company looking to capitalize on existing customer relationships. We believe the material below is applicable across the board. Established companies should be thinking about approaching new businesses like startups to avoid being disrupted. Startups should also be aware of how short-term traction can inform long-term strategy planning.

We've also separated out the "Problem Space" from the "Solution Space." A lot of the available resources in the Product Management space today dive deeply into solutions and execution, but we think what separates great Product Managers from the rest is a more complete understanding of the problems they're trying to solve. We'll get into that a bit more later. 

We've enabled comments using Disqus, so please feel free to leave any feedback in the comments section on the right. As usual, also feel free to email us at [hello@inroad.co](mailto:hello@inroad.co)!

We've organized the Best of Product Management  as follows:

<ol type="I">
      <li><a href="#first-h">What is Product Management?</a></li>
      <li><a href="#second-h">Problem Space: Understanding the Customer</a></li>
      <li><a href="#third-h">Marrying Business and Product Strategy</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fourth-h">Defining the Product: Vision, Objective, Key Result</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fifth-h">The Roadmap</a></li>
      <li><a href="#sixth-h">The Spec aka PRD</a></li>
      <li><a href="#seventh-h">Validating your Solution</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eigth-h">Managing the Build</a></li>

      <li><a href="#tenth-h">Other Helpful Resources</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eleventh-h">Bonus: Building a PM Org</a></li>
</ol>

By no means should this serve as a comprehensive syllabus, but we've found these resources to be helpful to our clients in the past. Hopefully they're helpful to you as well!

<h2 id="first-h">I. What is Product Management?</h2>

The “job” of a Product Manager, at its core, is actually pretty simple. Ultimately, the Product Manager is responsible for the success of the products and features they oversee within a company. How they go about defining and obtaining that success is the tricky part. Before jumping into the job itself, let's find out a bit more about the history of Product Management.

<h3>History of Product Management </h3>

[Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) is an experienced Product Manager who cofounded the blog "Mind the Product" (one of our favorites). In his article on [The History and Evolution of Product Management](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/10/history-evolution-product-management/) he breaks out how we got here. 

If you Prefer an audio version, feel free to listen to [The (Abbreviated) History Of Product Management](http://rocketship.fm/episodes/the_abbreviated_history_of_product_management/) podcast by [Rocketship.fm](http://rocketship.fm):

      </div><br>


<h3>So... What is Product Management?</h3>

Ok, so back to the original question. We think [Martin Eriksson](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin) does an excellent job of answering this question in his post [What Exactly is a Product Manager?](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/). We promise we won't exclusively link to his content, but as one of the most well-regarded voices in the Product Management community, we think he does an awesome job of setting the table here.

While we’re not associated with the many Product Management courses available online, we do recognize that they’ve produced some helpful (and sometimes free) resources. One of those is [The Product Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-product-podcast/id1219400787) from [Product School](https://www.productschool.com/). They do a really nice job in their “What is Product Management?” podcast of explaining what Product Management is (and is not):

      </div><br>


<h3>Good vs Great Product Management</h3>

We now have a good understanding of what Product Managers are responsible for, broadly speaking, but what does great Product Management look like? As we said earlier, great PMs understand the problem. Said another way, they understand the customer and the customer's problems before trying to come up with solutions. To open this up a bit, let's ask some the "greats" to define greatness in Product Management:

[Good Product Manager / Bad Product Manager](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) by [Ben Horowitz](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz) is a post that you've probably seen before if you've done any reading on Product Management before this. Ben founded and ran the enterprise software company, Opsware, before founding and running the venture capital firm, Andreeson Horowitz. Ben prefaces this blog post with a warning, "This document was written 15 years ago and is probably not relevant for today’s product managers. I present it here merely as an example of a useful training document.” It holds up.

[Ian McAllister](http://twitter.com/ianmcall) provides a helpful take on this question on Quora in his answer to [What distinguishes the Top 1% of product managers from the Top 10%?](https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-Top-1-of-product-managers-from-the-Top-10/answer/Ian-McAllister). Ian was a Product Manager at Microsoft, Amazon, and Airbnb. With experience like that, he found himself well-equipped to answer this question on Quora.

We don't think an MBA is a requirement for great Product Management, but we do think publications like the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/) are incredibly helpful resources. [What It Takes to Become a Great Product Manager](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager) by [Julia Austin](https://twitter.com/austinfish) is one such resource. Julia is a Senior Lecturer in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at the Harvard Business School. She also has deep experience on the operating and advising side. One of the things I like about this article is looking beyond core competencies to look at EQ and company fit. 

Great Product Managers are also willing to take great (calculated) risks - especially when the pace of business necessitates it. In his talk "10x Not 10% : Product Management by Orders of Magnitude" [Ken Norton](https://twitter.com/kennethn), Product Manager and Senior Operating Partner at Google Ventures, talks about how Product Managers should fight their instinct for loss aversion and go for moonshots:

<h2 id="second-h">II. Problem Space: Understanding the Customer</h2>

Products are solutions and before you develop a smart solution, you need a complete understanding of the problem. In the case of a business, the problem is the job that the customer is paying you to do. It’s important to remember that your customers are people (assuming you’re reading this before The Robot Revolution). Understanding your customers on a “personal” level is probably the most important skill that a product manager can have. We recognize that there are likely going to be multiple customers (stakeholders) that the Product Team should be concerned with - including internal stakeholders and external decision makers, but for the purpose of this guide, we’ll focus on the end users. We need to get to know the end user above all others because ultimately these are the customers we’re trying to serve.

<h3>Customers First</h3>

We'd be remiss if we didn't have at least one piece of content here from the great Steve Jobs. This video is from Apple's 1997  Worldwide Developer Conference. In it, Steve Jobs explains to a disgruntled developer why it's important to start with the customer and not with the technology:

<h3>Jobs to be Done</h3>

Harvard professor, Theodore Levitt, is often quoted as saying, "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole." We think this quote perfectly distills down the idea of "Jobs to be done." The educator who popularized this idea is another Harvard Professor named [Clayton Christensen](https://twitter.com/claychristensen). Here, Clayton explains what he means when he talks about jobs to be done. If you're already a Product Manager, and you've heard the term "milkshakes," this is where it comes from:

For a bit more information on jobs to be done - see Clayton Christensen's post in HBR [Know Your Customers’ “Jobs to Be Done”](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)


<h3>Customer Needs / Outcomes</h3>

The go-to resource for incorporating jobs to be done into customer outcomes is the book [What Customers Want](https://www.amazon.com/What-Customers-Want-Outcome-Driven-Breakthrough/dp/0071408673) by [Anthony Ulwick](https://twitter.com/Ulwick). The book maps out exactly how to use customer input to drive innovative Product decisions. For those who aren't inclined to pick up the whole book, Anthony published an article in the Sloan Review entitled [Giving Customers a Fair Hearing](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/giving-customers-a-fair-hearing/), which explains how to clearly define customer needs. The basic structure is:
